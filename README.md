## Data Analysis
Includes some intersting code worked with

For finding the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the
estimated date of delivery.

```sql
  with sidcte as(
  select
  c.customer_state,
  round(avg(date_diff(o.order_delivered_customer_date,o.order_purchase_timestamp,day)),2) as
  avg_deliver,
  round(avg(date_diff(o.order_estimated_delivery_date,o.order_delivered_customer_date,day)),2
  ) as avg_estimate,
  from `CaseStudyTarget.customers` c
  join
  `CaseStudyTarget.orders` o on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
  group by c.customer_state
  ),
  siddcte as(
  select *,
  dense_rank() over(order by difff desc) as rnk
  from (
  select *,round(avg_deliver-avg_estimate,2) as difff
  from sidcte
  )
  )
  select * from siddcte
  where rnk<6
  order by rnk;
```
## Results
1.Implemented analysis on sales over the past year and concluded that the number of orders 
have risen by 51,992

2.Implemented analysis on the time the order and concluded that most of the customer placed 
their order in afternoon i.e from 1 pm to 6:59 pm

3.Implemented analysis on orders based on states and found that arounf 41% of orders are 
placed from state SP from Brazil

4.Implemented analysis on payment and found that most of the customer do their payments 
using credit card followed by UPI

## Recommendations
1.The state â€˜SPâ€™ has the lowest freight value which means the travelling cost of
product is less in return the profit generated by the state increases, whereas the state
â€˜RRâ€™ has highest freight value, so the good network should be established to reduce
the travelling cost

2.Most of the Brazilian Customers do their payment using Credit Card. More rewards
can be introduced on credit card and UPI to increase the Sales.

3.Approx. 41% of the customer are from state â€˜SPâ€™ which isnâ€™t good sign for the seller
in other states and company too. More advertising should be done in other states and
new offers on the product should be released frequently
